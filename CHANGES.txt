v2.6.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed the bazaar, database performance, forum wrapping, and
database wrapper.

Jan 7, 2017 - Fixed a typo in the bazaar script that was preventing
              any results from showing up.
              (Maudigan)
              Fixed a reference to the template class in db.php that
              was preventing the database performane stats from
              dumping out.
              (Maudigan)
              Updated db.php wrappers for PHP7
              (Athrogate)
              Updated db wrapper to be an object so it wouldn't
              interfere with header/footer db object

v2.6
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Modified some of the code to allow you to embed charbrowser into
a forum header/footer.

Oct 21, 2017 - Between your forum headers include charbrowser
               index.php. Prior to the include turn the simple 
               headers on with:
               $charbrowser_simple_header = true;
               Tell charbrowser that it's being wrapped with:
               $charbrowser_wrapped = true;
               Lastly, you need to set the root path of charbrowser
               so it can correctly find the other images/stylesheets
               to include when the page renders:
               $charbrowser_root_url = "http://eg.com/charbrowser/";
               Those steps are only necessary if you want to wrap
               Charbrowser in your forums.
               The other changes are pretty widespread. A lot of 
               objects have been renamed to reduce the chance that it
               conflicts with your forum objects. Do a version
               compare to see what all changed.
               (Maudigan)

v2.52
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Added omens of war flags, moved $version out of the config.

May 17, 2017 - Added the OOW flags to language.php and flags.php
               (Maudigan)
               Some servers were keeping their old config file,
               which has the version stamp in it. This made it hard
               to identify what build a server was using. That value
               was moved to a stand alone version.php. The order the
               files are included means the variable in version.php
               should overwrite the old one in your config, however
               you should probably pull the new config.template or
               remove the $version variable from config.php.
               (Maudigan)

v2.51
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This release makes the item/spell links more customizable

October 3, 2016 - Added new customizable link templates to the confi
                  file. This is for servers that don't use the PEQ DB
                  so they don't want to link to mqemu's database.
                  (Maudigan)


v2.5
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This release fixes the aa and corpse pages, but it is mostly to clean
up the code and add features for developers who may want to alter or
extend the code.

September 30, 2014 - Added some new methods to the Template class that
                     let developers access the magelo data in a JSON
                     or XML format. The template values were never
                     meant to be output this way so it's not the
                     cleanest data. To see it, add a variable named
                     "api" to your GET, i.e.
                     corpse.php?char=Maudigan&api (Maudigan)
October 4, 2014 -    Fixed a call to the nonexistant mymessage_die 
                     in item.php. (Maudigan)
                     Moved DB connection stuff out of the config
                     file (Maudigan)
May 22, 2016 -       Cleaned up the way queries are templated.
                     Added wrappers on all the mysql functions which
                     is mostly so future modifications can be done quicker
                     when something changes. it also lets us gather
                     database performance stats (when enabled) without
                     having to run queries twice. It should also let
                     people swap to non mysql databases and only have to 
                     edit db.php instead of a whole mess of
                     different modules. (Maudigan)
                     The database performance code was rewritten to use
                     the normal templating system instead of writing its
                     own HTML. (Maudigan)
                     General code cleanup, replaced tabs with spaces (they're
                     better, so eat-it). Added some extra comments, removed 
                     some old ones. I didn't mark all of it so if youre 
                     curious you'll have to do a compare. (Maudigan)
May 24, 2016 -       Functionized the code that converts directories into
                     the list of options for the signature builder.
                     Made a default return value for profile.php->GetValue()
                     and set the value to 0 to fix the display of skills.php
May 30, 2016 -       Updated aa.php to implement the new aa storage method.
                     Updated corpse.php with the blob changes that I missed
                     on the last update.


v2.41
----------------------------------------------------------------------
September 28, 2014 - added a database stats gathering tool. Uncomment
                     the setting at the bottom of config.php and it will
                     cause every query, its runtime and an explanation
                     to be dumped at the bottom of each page. WARNING:
                     the dumped data is publicly viewable. (Maudigan)
                     Altered the profile class to have a constructor
                     that recieves the charname and populates the
                     basic character data. This permitted the removal
                     of an extra query on nearly every screen. (Maudigan)
September 29, 2014 - completed the character blob modifications.
                     this involved rewriting most of the profile.php
                     script and putting a bandaid on aa.php (Maudigan)
                     Added the missing AA tabs. (Maudigan)

v2.4 (beta)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
September 26, 2014 - Akkadius removed the character blob from the
                     database and triggered this update. All changes
                     are to accomodate the new storage method.
                     Rewrote profile.php, this involved removing old
                     comments; see old versions to view them.
                     Changed character_ table referenes to character_data
                     in multiple files.
                     Rewrote the code that grabbed a characters guild
                     name and rank as the the blob doesn't exist and the
                     new method doesnt track a character guild id. I used
                     this as an opportunity to swap from a WHERE join to
                     a standard JOIN. (Maudigan)


v2.3
----------------------------------------------------------------------
February 24, 2014 - Changed item icons to use PNG instead of GIF (Maudigan/Warmonger)
                    Added backstab damage to item display (Kinglykrab)
                    Corrected spelling errors (Kinglykrab)
                    Fixed syntax error in css (Kinglykrab)
February 25, 2014 - Added Heroic stats and aug types (Kinglykrab)
                    Added infinite charge text to items (Kinglykrab)
                    Added Drakkin/Powersource to bazaar (Kinglykrab)



v2.25

February 9, 2014 - Fixed charm item type getting set wrong (Maudigan)
February 12, 2014 - Added/Updated item icons 2588-4819. (Maudigan)
